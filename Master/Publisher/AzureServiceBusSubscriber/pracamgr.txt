\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Introduction to the problem domain}
Nowadays, IT solutions commonly are the core of maintenance and organization of many products and companies. The system for any enterprise with notable size is often very complex and composed of few independent solutions. The grown of a system commonly relates to the new contracts, connection to resources provided by new business partners or new technological solutions, such as cloud services, which have recently been a trend in software development. Due to the connection between them, such as infrastructure is called "Spaghetti architecture", which illustrated the unefficient, lack of order and hard to manage side of IT Solution.
Reffering to this problem, many architectural patterns have been created over the years.
Microservices are approach of software architecture which addresses many modern application challanges.  Microservices offers several adventages including scalability and flexibility in managing complex applications. 
The main aspect is the good design of communcitaion and techonology choose between them. 
 

\section{Contribution and objective of the thesis}
For the purpose of conducting research for a master's thesis, a system based on the microservices architecture was developed, along with the creation of datasets. 
Datasets were designed in various forms to perform experiments for a few different purposes of communication between subsystems. 
Over the study, metrics are collected at multiple stages, starting from the serialization of data into an appropriate format for a given type of communication, to the reception of data and its subsequent deserialization into an object.

The study ends with a simulation that emulated the real-word scenario of data transmission. 
The data is send to the Gazebo simulates environment, impacting the situation of data transmission to the robot in the Gazebo simulation environment, triggering the robot’s motion.  It becomes possible to gain insides about how the type of communication impacts the trajectory and effecienty of the robot motion. 
The findings of this study have the potential to contribute to the development of more efficient and optimized communication strategies within microservices-based applications.

\section{Short summary of chapters}

TODO IN THE LATE STATE
Co poruszam w kazdym z chapterow




\chapter{Overview of technologies and terminology}

This chapter will focus on the fundamentals of software architecture based in the history and its evolution, including the comparison between monolith, microservices and software-oriented architecture. The communication problem between microservices and cloud solutions will be also covered. 

\subsection{Microservices} 

The term 'Microservice' defining the small application which has single responsibility to the whole system. It has only one reason to change or to be replaced.


The idea of the microservices is related to the demand of scaling along different axes independently which is more efficient at delivering software into production, or on other form of continuous delivery. This is a big trend in modern software architecture, that is why it is is extremely important to study it in perspective of communication and data flow.

\subsection{Monolith}

To analyse the Microservices it is good to menthion about the Monolith architecture, which is traditional model of software program. Monolith is build as a single unit. which is self-contained and independent from other applications. 
The main disadventage of monolith is the difficulty of making changes. Any change, even a small one, involves updating the entire stack and deploying the updated version, which is very time consuming when the system is big. 

However monolith has also some advantages.
\begin{itemize}
\item
Performance 
It could be better than in microservices 
\item 
Easy debugging
All code located in one place, it is easier to debug.
\item 
Ease deployment
One executable file is easier to deploy than multiple
\item Simplified testing
End to end testing can be performed faster than in the distrubuted systems
\end{itemize} 
\subsection{Service-oriented architecture}
The heavyweight nature of monolith architecture was slowly decomposed into modules. This process led to the formation of a new architecture known as service-oriented architecture (SOA). 
Modules are communicating using the Enterprise Service Bus. Software-Oriented architecture manages and coorinates the services it delivers throught this layer. 
For the whole system Enterprise Service Bus is single point of failure and if there occure any damege or delay (overwhelmed), the entire system could be affected.
Modules perform various type of operations and transactions. There is no strict dividion into separates role for the particular module. The whole system is using sigle dedicated database enginee. 

\subsubsection{Domain-Driven Design}
Domain driven Design is a approach to the software development which concetrates on modeling sofware architecture to match a domain. The structure of application including the name convention of a classes, method and varaibles, should match the buisness domain.


\section{Microservices}
Adrian Cockcroft, famous technologist and strategist, defines a microservices architecture as a service-oriented architecture consisting of loosely coupled components that operate within well-defined boundaries.

Loosely coupled means that services can be updated independently, without requiring changes to other services. If you have a collection of small, specialised services that still need to be updated simultaneously, they cannot be considered microservices. There is lack of loose coupling principle between them.

SOA was a precursor of microservices, laying the foundations for the development of ideas related to the modularization of services and applications. Microservices, although inspired by SOA architecture, have extended the concept of modularity. Microservices not only separate applications in order to optimize the amount of functions and data, but also segregate operations in terms of business logic basing on the Domain Driven Design.

Each microservice has single resposibility for the system and has separate database engine. 

\subsubsection{Characterystics}
The James Lewis and Martin Fowler in their  
\href{https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html}{article} have wrote down the set of characteristics related with Microservices Architecture.

\section{SOA vs Microservices}

\chapter{Problem analysis}

\section{Evolution of software architecture}

The history of microservices can be traced back to the 1990s, when the first ideas and concepts of distributed software architecture emerged. However, the term 'microservices' has only become popular in the last decade, and their development has been linked to advances in technology and changes in approaches to application development.

Early work on microservices focused on finding better ways to create service-based software. One important step was the introduction of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) as an approach to creating modular and loosely coupled services.
Service-Oriented Architecture has made it possible to create applications consisting of independent components that can be easily scaled and developed.

In 2011, the term 'microservices' (Microservices) emerged, which was introduced by Martin Fowler and James Lewis in their article 'Microservices: a definition of this new architectural term'.
\section{Real-Life Case Analysis } 
\subsection{Netflix as a microservices pioneer}
Netflix has played an important role in developing and promoting microservices architecture. Netflix was one of the pioneers in using microservices as the main approach to building its streaming platform.

Netflix has stareted out as a small rental company. They offered an online DVD subscriptions through the Internet. Movies were mailed to the customers in the form of DVD's with prepaid return envelopes. 
Nowadays Netflix is huge streaming platform which content is producted in-house ( Netflix Orginals) or producted by other companies and Netflix has distribution right to.

With the huge shift in product delivery from postal services to online services, Netflix needed more and more resources on the Internet and powerful software, because its due to the increase of the demand, its infrastructure couldn't keep up. 
The company made the decision to move its IT infrastructure from private data centers to a public cloud and replace its monolithic architecture with a microservices architecture. However, at that time, the term "microservices" was not widely known, and the structure itself was not well-established.

Netflix emerged as one of the first prominent companies to successfully transition from a monolith to a cloud-based microservices architecture. This achievement was recognized in 2015 when it received the JAX Special Jury award. Today, Netflix manages and supports various parts of its platform through over a thousand microservices.

\section{Overview of the literature}
\chapter{Communication within Microservices}

In microservices architecture there is few available communication patterns.
The system architect is responsible for analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of each pattern. This evaluation process is crucial in order to make an informed decision and choose the most suitable communication pattern for the specific scenario of the system. By carefully considering the pros and cons of each pattern, the architect can ensure effective and efficient communication between the services in the system. Ultimately, the chosen communication pattern will play a significant role in determining the overall performance and functionality of the application. 

There are few aspects on which the communication between microservices has key value. 

\subsubsection{Scalability}
\subsubsection{Resilience}
\subsubsection{Data consistency}
\subsubsection{Synchronization}
\subsubsection{Security}
\section{Communication Forms}
\subsection{Synchronous}
Synchronous communication refers to a communication pattern where services interact by exchanging messages and waiting for a timely response before proceeding further. In this approach, a service initiates a request to another service and waits for the response, blocking its execution until a reply is received.
\subsection{Asynchronous}
The most common communication approach. Asynchronous communication refers to a communication pattern where services interact without requiring immediate and direct response. In this approach, a service sends a message or request to another service and continues its execution without waiting for a response. The receiving service processes the message independently and may respond at a later time or not at all. 
\section{Patterns}

\item RESTful Web API Endpoint Integration
REST is an abbreviation of REpresentational State Transfer.
\item Messaging Integration
\item Streaming Integration

%\item What problem do I want (have to :-) to solve?
%\item Why the problem is important?
%\item How do others solve the problem?
%\item What are pros and cons of my solution?

\section{Synchronous vs Asynchronous}

"Synchronous
When it comes to the communication layer between microservices, synchronous is certainly
the most widely used approach. Within this topic, some protocols are well known and
others less so. The range of direct protocols is as follows:
HTTP
TCP
WebSockets
Sockets
RPC
SOAP"

"Asynchronous
In some direct communications between microservices, timing may be important, but there
are other times where the process can simply be asynchronous; there's no need for an
immediate response or confirmation of success, all that is required is to simply run a task.
For this approach, the message broker is just perfect.
Some software applications appear a good choice for message brokers, such as RabbitMQ,
ActiveMQ, ZeroMQ, Kafka, and Redis. Each of these options has its own peculiarities, some
are faster, others are more resilient. Again, the business setting is going to determine which
technology is used."
